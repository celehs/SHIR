\title{SHIR_fit: aggregate the locally derived summary data using the proposed method in SHIR paper.}
\usage{
SHIR_fit(
  H_lst,
  d_lst,
  n_lst,
  lambda_lst = NULL,
  lambda_g_lst = NULL,
  tune = "BIC"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{H_lst}{list of locally derived Hessian matrix}

\item{d_lst}{list of locally derived gradient vector}

\item{n_lst}{vector of the sample sizes at local sites}

\item{lambda_lst}{candidate set of the tuning parameter for mu,
(corresponds to sqrt(N)lambda in the SHIR paper)
If not specified or specified as Null by the user, it will be set as 0.3*c(5:25)sqrt(nlog(p)).}

\item{lambda_g_lst}{candidate set of the tuning parameter for alpha,
(corresponds to lambda_g in the SHIR paper)
If not specified or specified as Null by the user, it will be set as c(0.6,0.9).}

\item{tune}{the information criterion used for model selection:
options include 'AIC', 'BIC', 'mBIC' and 'RIC', which put different weights on the degree of freedom.
If not specified by the user, it will be set as 'BIC'.}
}
\value{
min.lambda: the selected tuning parameters with the minimum information criterion

min.beta: matrices of the fitted SHIR estimator
(the m-th column loads the fitted coefficient (beta) for the m-th site,
the first row is the fitted intercepts)
}
