# SHIR

## Overview

The algorithm performs SHIR, a novel federated learning approach used for aggregating high dimensional and heterogeneous data from local sites, in order to obtain efficient estimators of the logistic model.
SHIR protects individual data through a summary-statistics-based integrating procedure. At each local site, it fits LASSO to derive summary data that is free of the individual level information. 
Susequently, at the central node, it aggregates the derived statistics at the local sites, and produces the integrative estimator.


## Background

Meta-analyzing multiple studies allows for more precise estimates and enables investigation of generalizability. 
However, in the presence of heterogeneity across studies and high dimensional
predictors, such integrative analysis is highly challenging. 
An major application of such integrative analysis is to develop generalizable predictive models using electronic health records (EHR) data from different hospitals. 
EHR data is subject to high dimensional features and important privacy constraints.
The procedure SHIR  protects individual data through summary-statistics-based integrating procedure, accommodates between study heterogeneity in both the covariate distribution and model parameters, and attains consistent variable selection.
