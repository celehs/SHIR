# SHIR

## Overview

The algorithm performs SHIR, a novel federated learning approach used for aggregating high dimensional
and heterogeneous data from local sites, in order to obtain efficient estimators of the logistic model.
SHIR protects individual data through a summary-statistics-based integrating procedure. At each local site,
it fits LASSO to derive summary data that is free of the individual level information. Susequently, at the central node, it aggregates the derived statistics at the local sites, and produces the integrative estimator.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of SHIR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SHIR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("celehs/SHIR")
```
## Example


```{r example}
library(SHIR)
## basic example code
